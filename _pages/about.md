Welcome to my home on the web!

My name is Syna Sreng. I am a postdoctoral researcher at King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL), Bangkok, Thailand. 
I started my journey as a computer vision researcher at KMITL where I earned a Ph.D degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Together with my girlfriend, we have developed several algorithms to automatically detect diseases on different types of medical images such as retinal fundus image, x-rays images, and microscope images. Currently, I am working on deep learning to accurately detect multi-class of ocular diseases to assist ophthalmologists in primary screening processing, and concurrently working with my team to develop the intelligent systems that can help the radiologists to idenfity COVID-19 on Chest X-rays. I have a very keen interest on how AI is going to transform modern healthcare system.

Iâ€™m interested in the following research topics: image processing, computer vision, and machine learning, especially the application of medical image processing
