Biography
======
<p align="justify">Syna Sreng received his engineering degree in Electrical and Energy Engineering (option: Electronic Automatic and Telecommunication) from Institute of Technology of Cambodia, Phnom Penh, Cambodia in 2011, and received M.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer and Electrical Engineering from King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL), Bangkok, Thailand in 2013 and 2019 respectively. He has joined Computer Lab(II), led by Asst. Prof. Dr. Noppadol Maneerat, since 2012 as a research student. His research interests are in the area of image processing, computer vision, and machine learning, especially the application of medical image processing. His research outcomes include 6 journal papers and 7 conference proceedings covering various topics in development of accurate algorithms to automatedly detect diseases on different types of medical images such as retinal images, x-ray images, and microscope images. He is currently a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of professor Noppadol Maneerat at KMITL, Bangkok, Thailand.</p>
